angularJS directive for NETEYE Activity Indicator

This is an experiment, on creating directives for angularJS targeted to http://neteye.github.io/activity-indicator.html

Required:
1.) jQuery, as NETEYE uses jQuery

To use (as an attribute):

    <div class="indicator" indicator="isBusy"></div>

where "isBusy" is one of your $scope variables....
